# Hyperion Dev Data Science (Fundamentals) Final Capstone Project: SpaCy TextBlob Sentiment Analysis

## Overview

This project demonstrates sentiment analysis of customer reviews using SpaCy and TextBlob. It includes modules for data preprocessing, sentiment analysis, and visualization, providing insights into customer opinions expressed in product reviews.

### Features

#### Data Preprocessing:
Cleans and prepares customer review text data.
Removes stop words, punctuation, and numeric characters.
Lemmatizes text for linguistic analysis.

#### Sentiment Analysis:
Utilizes SpaCy TextBlob to extract sentiment assessments.
Calculates polarity scores (positive/negative sentiment).
Labels polarity scores and review ratings for interpretability.

#### Visualizations (Streamlit App):
Distribution of polarity scores vs. review ratings.
Polarity scores vs. labeled review ratings (for analyzing model performance).
Accuracy and balanced accuracy scores.
Confusion matrix for precision visualization.
Classification report for detailed performance metrics.

### Dataset

#### Source: 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datafiniti/consumer-reviews-of-amazon-products
#### Description: 
The dataset is Datafiniti's 'Consumer Reviews of Amazon Products,' publically availabile via Kaggle.
